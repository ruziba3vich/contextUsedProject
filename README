This project is for twits like our old Twitter platform, I did not add user authorization and user
authentication parts, because I got very short dead-line, however, when a user sends a request to
`localhost:7777/authorize` end point, if the user already exists in the database, all other
requests will belong to the user, just without a token like `jwt`.

This project user `contect` package, in every service that makes a call to the database, we send
the `context.Context` object, too, to handle whether the request takes long time to be executed or
not. Because at some points user might try to send requests to the `API` without connecting to a
proper connection, which might cause the waste of server data usage.
